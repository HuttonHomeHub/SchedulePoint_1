### Minor Changes

- [#96](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/96) [`7aa0132`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/7aa0132662097a928224901833896b07df583f22) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Cross-plan dependency CRUD + the plan-level DAG invariant + authz (inter-project M2, ADR-0045 §3/§6,
  F3). A new `cross-plan-dependencies` NestJS module — a dark sibling of `dependencies` — lets a Planner
  draw a **live inter-project link** between two activities in **different plans of the same
  organisation**. Nothing consumes the edges yet (the derivation seam + programme recalc are F4/F5), so
  `main` stays byte-identical: the engine and schedule service are untouched.

  - **API (`@repo/api`)** — org-scoped `POST/GET/DELETE …/cross-plan-dependencies` (create derives both
    plan ids from the endpoint activities; never from input) plus per-plan (incoming) and per-activity
    (both-direction) list routes. Create loads **both** endpoints active in-org (anti-IDOR uniform 404),
    rejects a same-plan edge (**422 `CROSS_PLAN_SAME_PLAN`**, N31), and — under a new **org-scoped**
    advisory lock (a distinct key namespace from the per-plan write lock) inside one transaction —
    enforces the **plan-level DAG** (**409 `CROSS_PLAN_CYCLE_DETECTED`**, N30), asserts the pen on the
    **successor** plan (ADR-0028), and rejects a duplicate `(pred, succ, type)` (**409
    `DUPLICATE_CROSS_PLAN_DEPENDENCY`**, N33). Delete is pen-gated and soft. A new
    **`dependency:link_cross_plan`** permission (Planner + Org Admin) gates linking; reads reuse
    `dependency:read`.
  - **Types (`@repo/types`)** — `CrossPlanDependencySummary` (carries both plan ids, no `isDriving`) and
    `CROSS_PLAN_DEPENDENCY_CONFLICT_MESSAGES` (the one-voice N30/N31/N33 copy).

- [#96](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/96) [`7aa0132`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/7aa0132662097a928224901833896b07df583f22) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Cross-plan schedule staleness tracking (inter-project M2, ADR-0045 §5 / ADR-0035 §30.7, F6). Every CPM
  recalculation now stamps the plan's `schedule_computed_at` freshness cursor, and the schedule summary
  read tells a planner whether their plan is **stale** relative to its cross-plan upstreams — so they know
  to run a programme recalculate. Pull-only (no background push job); the pure engine is untouched.

  - **API (`@repo/api`)** — `recalculatePlan` stamps `schedule_computed_at = now()` inside the same
    engine-owned write path as the per-activity results (a raw `UPDATE plans …`, so it does **not** bump
    the plan's optimistic `version`/`updated_at`, ADR-0022). Both the single-plan recalc and the programme
    solve (which loops that unit, upstream-first) stamp every plan they write. `GET …/schedule/summary`
    computes staleness **on read**: guarded on the plan having ≥1 cross-plan edge, it resolves the plan's
    upstream closure (reusing `resolveProgrammeOrder`) and compares each upstream's cursor against the
    plan's in one batched query — flagging the plan stale iff any upstream is newer (or the plan was never
    computed while an upstream has).
  - **Types (`@repo/types`)** — two new **optional** fields on `PlanScheduleSummary`: `scheduleStale`
    and `staleUpstreamPlanIds`. They are **absent** for a plan with no cross-plan edges, so an ordinary
    single-plan summary response is byte-identical to before M2 (the parity gate holds). A programme
    recalculate — which recomputes the closure upstream-first — clears the staleness.

- [#96](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/96) [`7aa0132`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/7aa0132662097a928224901833896b07df583f22) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Synchronous programme-recalc orchestration (inter-project M2, ADR-0045 §4 / ADR-0035 §30.8, F5). A new
  endpoint recalculates a target plan's **upstream cross-plan closure** in dependency order so the target's
  derived inter-project bounds (F4) read fresh upstream dates. The **pure CPM engine is untouched** and each
  plan is recalculated with the **existing** single-plan recalc transaction — no recalc body is duplicated.

  - **API (`@repo/api`)** — `POST …/plans/:planId/schedule/recalculate-programme` (`schedule:calculate`,
    Planner + Org Admin). A pure `resolveProgrammeOrder(targetPlanId, edges)` resolves the target's upstream
    closure in **topological order, upstream-first** (the target last), tie-broken by plan id so the order —
    and thus the per-plan advisory-lock acquisition order — is **stable and deadlock-free**. The
    orchestrator (`ScheduleService.recalculateProgramme`) loops the closure, invoking the shared single-plan
    recalc unit per plan (each its own ADR-0022 transaction + advisory lock + pen), so every downstream plan
    reads its upstreams' freshly-written dates. A residual plan-level cycle (unreachable given the F3 DAG
    invariant) fails loud (`ProgrammeCycleError` → alarm 500, nothing written).
  - **Fail-fast pen pre-check (default, ADR-0045 CQ-3)** — before any write, the pen is asserted on **every**
    closure plan, **collecting all** blocked plan ids in one pass; if any is held by another editor the whole
    solve is refused with a single **423 `PROGRAMME_PLANS_LOCKED`** carrying the `blockedPlanIds` list —
    nothing is written. Inert unless `PLAN_EDIT_LOCK_ENFORCED` is on.
  - **Result + roll-up** — the `200` response returns per-plan summaries (in recalculation order) plus a
    programme roll-up (`planCount`, and the summed **N32** `crossPlanUpstreamMissingCount`).
  - **Types (`@repo/types`)** — `ProgrammeScheduleResult` / `ProgrammeSchedulePlanResult` and the
    `ProgrammeScheduleLockedDetails` (`PROGRAMME_PLANS_LOCKED`) 423 payload.

  A programme with no cross-plan edges has a closure of just the target, so this is byte-identical to a
  single-plan recalc; `main` stays releasable.

### Minor Changes

- [#94](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/94) [`4e78ff1`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/4e78ff11f9468ed8511f2e780dc2072abacc7050) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Turn on the remaining eight off-by-default web surfaces (Resources, Duration types, Resource
  levelling, Earned Value, Cost accrual, Activity steps, Resource curves, Inter-project external dates)
  by flipping their `VITE_*` flags from default-off to default-on — after clearing every documented
  pre-flip blocker. The engine/API behind each surface was already live; this exposes it in the UI by
  default.

  Pre-flip remediation (TECH_DEBT [#38](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/issues/38)/[#39](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/issues/39)/[#40](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/issues/40)/[#41](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/issues/41)/[#44](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/issues/44)):

  - **API (`@repo/api`)** — **Pen-gate resource-assignment writes** ([#39](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/issues/39)): assign / edit / unassign now
    call `PlanEditLockService.assertHoldsPen` like the activity write path (a units/rate edit persists the
    owning activity's derived duration, a scheduling mutation), returning **423** to a non-holder when
    `PLAN_EDIT_LOCK_ENFORCED` is on; 423 e2e added. **Money overflow guards** (#40a): every integer
    minor-unit money field (`budgetedExpense`/`actualExpense`/`budgetedCost`/`actualCost`) gains
    `@Max(MONEY_MINOR_UNITS_MAX)` and every `Decimal(18,4)` field
    (`costPerUnit`/`maxUnitsPerHour`/`budgetedUnits`/`unitsPerHour`/`actualUnits`) `@Max(DECIMAL_18_4_MAX)`,
    so an over-range value is a clean **422** rather than a precision-loss / column-overflow 500; boundary
    specs added. **Engine-owned `external_driven`** ([#41](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/issues/41)): a new per-activity boolean column mirroring
    `constraint_violated` (metadata-only migration), written by the recalc batched `unnest` UPDATE and
    aggregated in the read-summary so `externalDrivenCount` is truthful on a plain summary read.
  - **Types (`@repo/types`)** — `ActivitySummary` gains `externalDriven: boolean`; new
    `MONEY_MINOR_UNITS_MAX` / `DECIMAL_18_4_MAX` bounds.
  - **Web (`@repo/web`)** — **Row-actions `Menu`** ([#38](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/issues/38)): the activities table's per-row actions move from
    a spread of ghost buttons to a single overflow `⋯` trigger opening the APG `Menu`
    (Logic/Progress/Resources/Steps/Edit/Delete, role-gated) — meeting the "dense row actions use a Menu,
    never hover-only" standard. **External badge** ([#41](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/issues/41)): an "External" row badge in the Name cell mirrors
    the "Conflict" badge, driven by the engine's per-activity `externalDriven`. **Context gating** ([#44](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/issues/44)):
    the Steps row action is coupled to Earned Value (its only consumer), and the resource loading-curve
    picker is hidden for zero-span milestones. Then all eight `flagDefaultOff` flags become `flagDefaultOn`.

  Parity: `compute.ts` and `level.ts` are untouched; `external_driven` is engine-owned output written on
  every recalc (false when not external-driven), so absent-data byte-parity holds and existing engine / EV
  goldens do not move. Not addressed here (documented follow-ups): #40b Contributor cost-progress wiring,
  [#42](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/issues/42) shared `SelectField`, [#43](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/issues/43) histogram bucket in URL.

### Minor Changes

- [#93](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/93) [`481d063`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/481d063a2c65722901dc8f66d6d08d710a1f88a1) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Cost accrual (M7 rung 5, ADR-0044 F1 / ADR-0035 §32). Each activity gains a settable `accrualType`
  (`START` / `UNIFORM` (default) / `END`) that governs **when** its cost lump-sum is recognised in the
  Earned-Value read's Planned-Value time-phasing — `START` at the activity start, `END` at its finish,
  `UNIFORM` linearly — reshaping the cost / cash-flow S-curve. It **never changes a CPM date**, feeds the
  scheduler nothing, and is a pure read-model extension of `earned-value.ts`: `UNIFORM` (or absent) is
  byte-identical to the pre-ADR-0044 phasing (the parity gate), so the existing Earned-Value goldens stay
  green. The engine (`compute.ts`) and the levelling pass (`level.ts`) are untouched.

  - **API (`@repo/api`)** — the create/update activity DTOs, the activity response DTO, and the EV read
    path (`schedule.service.getEarnedValue` + `loadEarnedValueActivities`) all carry `accrualType`
    (reuses `activity:update`; the EV read stays `cost:read`-gated). `AccrualType` / `ACCRUAL_TYPES`
    round-trip through `@repo/types`.
  - **Types (`@repo/types`)** — `ActivitySummary` gains `accrualType: AccrualType`.
  - **Conformance** — the EV adapter reads the fixture's `expenses.accrual_type` and collapses per-expense
    → one activity value (ADR-0044 §Q4); new first-principles goldens assert the phased PV to the minor
    unit for **E001** (£45,000 crane mobilisation, `START` — full PV at the start), **E002** (£68,000,
    `UNIFORM` — 50% at mid-window) and **E004** (£3,500 retention, `END` — nothing until the finish), plus
    a `UNIFORM`→`START` flip differential. The `accrual_start` / `accrual_uniform` / `accrual_end`
    capability tags flip ✅ (32 ✅ / 1 ⚪); ADR-0035 gains an **Accepted §32**.
  - **Web (`@repo/web`)** — a **Cost accrual** select (Start / Uniform / End) in the activity form's
    "Cost & earned value" fieldset, behind the new **off-by-default** `VITE_COST_ACCRUAL` flag; wired
    through the create/update mutation and seeded from the row so a stored value round-trips when hidden.

  Deferred (later ADR-0044 slices, not in this change): the period-trend cost **S-curve** chart series
  (read-model + web), weighted **activity steps** (F2), and **resource loading curves** (F3).

- [#91](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/91) [`272eb42`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/272eb420313809d0867ef81753ae4c705f631005) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - CPM **duration types** now drive the resource-units triad (M7 rung 4, ADR-0040). An activity carries a
  `durationType` (FIXED_DURATION_AND_UNITS_TIME (default) / FIXED_DURATION_AND_UNITS / FIXED_UNITS /
  FIXED_UNITS_TIME) and a driving resource assignment carries a `unitsPerHour` rate; editing any one of
  {duration, units, units/time} recomputes the correct **other** field via the pure `resolveTriad`
  function so `Units = Duration × Units/Time` stays true — and for FIXED_UNITS / FIXED_UNITS_TIME the
  **duration is derived** from the driving resource's units ÷ rate and fed to the CPM engine unchanged
  (the engine is untouched; the no-rate path is byte-identical). The recompute runs at the write boundary,
  in one optimistic-locked transaction spanning the activity + its driving assignment: an activity duration
  edit recomputes the assignment's units/rate; an assignment units/rate edit (with an `editedField`) can
  recompute the owning activity's duration — each bumping the sibling's `version`, documented per-endpoint.
  Boundary rejects: negative `unitsPerHour` (N19, `@Min(0)` + DB CHECK) and a zero rate on a units-driven
  recompute (N20, 422 `UNITS_PER_HOUR_ZERO`, before any division). Additive DTO fields (`durationType`,
  `unitsPerHour`, `editedField`) + response exposure; new shared types `DurationType` / `EditedField`.

- [#93](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/93) [`481d063`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/481d063a2c65722901dc8f66d6d08d710a1f88a1) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - EV2a: make the EV1 cost & percent-complete-type fields (ADR-0042) settable via the API. Passthrough only
  — no earned-value computation and no new endpoint (that is EV2b). Threads the already-landed schema columns
  through the create/update DTOs and the service/repository write paths so they persist without changing any
  behaviour. Client-settable inputs (all Planner/Org-Admin-gated writes): activities `percentCompleteType`
  (`DURATION` default / `UNITS` / `PHYSICAL`), `physicalPercentComplete` (0–100, N23), `budgetedExpense` /
  `actualExpense`; resources `costPerUnit` (cost rate, N22); assignments `budgetedCost` (null = derive later),
  `actualCost`, `actualUnits`; plan `eacMethod` (`CPI` default) / `currencyCode` (ISO-4217, nullable to clear).

  **Cost reads are Planner/Org-Admin only.** The commercially sensitive money **amounts** (`costPerUnit`,
  `budgetedCost` / `actualCost`, `budgetedExpense` / `actualExpense`) are deliberately NOT returned by the
  general entity GETs or in `@repo/types` summary types — they will be served only by the dedicated
  `cost:read`-gated Earned-Value read endpoint (EV2b), so a Viewer/Contributor can never read cost through a
  schedule read. The non-sensitive fields (`percentCompleteType`, `physicalPercentComplete`, `actualUnits` —
  a quantity like the already-public `budgetedUnits` —, `eacMethod`, `currencyCode`) remain in the summaries.
  Money on the wire is a plain `number` of minor units (`BIGINT` amounts → `Number(x)`, the `Decimal(18,4)`
  cost rate → `x.toNumber()`). Fully additive and behaviour-preserving: unset fields keep today's behaviour
  and nothing touches the CPM engine, recalc, or baseline capture.

- [#93](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/93) [`481d063`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/481d063a2c65722901dc8f66d6d08d710a1f88a1) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Earned Value is now proven against the P6-class conformance fixture (EV3, ADR-0042 / ADR-0035 §29). A
  new fixture→EV adapter (`earned-value-adapter.ts`) grounds `computeEarnedValue` in real fixture cost and
  %-complete data — resource `price_per_unit`, assignment `budgeted_units`/`actual_units`, and `expenses`
  rows for `A4200`/`A7100`/`A8010`/`A6100`/`A3010`/`A10300` plus their two real WBS-summary ancestors
  (`W4000`/`W7000`) — with a first-principles golden (BAC/PV/EV/AC → SPI/CPI/EAC to the minor unit) and
  three differentials proving a flipped option changes the output: the `percentCompleteType` flip on
  `A4200` (the fixture's own physical-vs-duration divergence case), the `eacMethod` flip, and the
  cost-baseline present/absent flip. The `%-complete-type` (`pct_physical`/`pct_units`) and cost/EV
  (`cost_*`) halves of the capability matrix's deferred row flip to ✅ (resource curves, cost
  accrual/period trending, and activity steps stay ⚪, named later rungs). ADR-0035 gains an **Accepted**
  **§29** (percent-complete-type & earned-value semantics) plus **N22–N24**.

  The Earned-Value module and read endpoint also gain the **N24** read-time data-quality signal: a new
  `costWarningCount` on `PlanEarnedValue` / `PlanEarnedValueResult` counts leaf activities that show
  booked actual cost/units while apparently not started — surfaced, never rejected, so spend-without-
  progress (the exact CV signal) is visible rather than silently accepted. Additive field; `0` when no
  activity triggers it.

- [#93](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/93) [`481d063`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/481d063a2c65722901dc8f66d6d08d710a1f88a1) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - **EV4a — conditional per-role cost reads (ADR-0042).** The money **amount** fields are readable again on
  the general entity responses, but ONLY when the caller holds `cost:read` (Planner + Org Admin),
  org-scoped — a Viewer/Contributor still NEVER sees cost. This supersedes the earlier EV2a "remove cost
  from all reads" cut with the security reviewer's preferred conditional-field-inclusion, and unblocks the
  EV4 web edit forms (which must read the current cost to prefill and not clobber it on save).

  Re-exposed (as `number | null` on the wire; `null` = unset OR caller-not-permitted): resource
  `costPerUnit`; assignment `budgetedCost` / `actualCost`; activity `budgetedExpense` / `actualExpense`.
  The gate is threaded via a `canReadCost` boolean the service computes once from the already-resolved
  organisation (`principal.can('cost:read', org.id)` — never `canAnywhere`, to avoid a cross-tenant IDOR)
  and passes to each response DTO's `.from(entity, canReadCost)` mapper. Every read path that returns these
  entities (resource get + list, activity get + list + plan-activities list, assignment list) gates
  consistently and **fails closed** — a non-`cost:read` caller gets `null` for every cost field. The
  `cost:read`-gated Earned-Value endpoint (EV2b) is unchanged. The `%`-complete / units / EAC / currency
  fields are unaffected (they were never gated). No schema, engine, or write-DTO changes.

- [#93](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/93) [`481d063`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/481d063a2c65722901dc8f66d6d08d710a1f88a1) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - External / inter-project dates now persist and flow into the CPM recalc (ADR-0043 / ADR-0035 §30, M1).
  An activity carries two optional calendar-day fields `externalEarlyStart` (an SNET-shaped forward lower
  bound, floored at the data date) and `externalLateFinish` (an FNLT-shaped backward upper bound) — imported
  commitments gating it from another project; either, both, or neither may be set. They are **soft** bounds,
  never mandatory pins: the engine clamps early start UP to / late finish DOWN to them on the existing
  forward/backward passes and flags the activity external-driven, never setting `constraintViolated`. A new
  plan scheduling option `ignoreExternalRelationships` (default `false`, byte-parity) drops every external
  bound so a plan can be viewed on its own logic vs. gated by its neighbours. Boundary reject: an external
  late finish before the external early start when both are set returns **422** `EXTERNAL_FINISH_BEFORE_START`
  (N26), with a nullable-safe DB CHECK backstop. The recalc + `GET …/schedule/summary` roll-up expose an
  `externalDrivenCount` (engine-derived on a recalculation). Additive DTO/response fields on the activity and
  plan resources; new shared type fields on `ActivitySummary`, `PlanSummary`, and `PlanScheduleSummary`. The
  no-external / option-off path is byte-identical.

- [#91](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/91) [`21818b7`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/21818b7af12c16f481d7547d6f9c1d0464a05a2c) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Expose the **multiple-float-paths** analysis over REST (ADR-0035 §19), closing the one deferred piece of
  M6-F6. `GET /organizations/:orgSlug/plans/:planId/schedule/float-paths?target=&maxPaths=` returns the
  ranked contiguous driving chains into a target activity — path 0 the driving chain (relative float 0),
  branch paths in non-decreasing relative-float order, bounded by `maxPaths` (default 10, max 50). It is a
  read-only analysis (`schedule:read`, every member): it recomputes the schedule live through the same
  engine-input builder `recalculate` uses, so it can never drift from a recalculation, and never persists.
  Relative float is returned in working days. 422 if the plan has no start date; 404 if the target activity
  is not active in the plan; 400 if `target` is missing or not a UUID. Adds the shared `PlanFloatPath` /
  `PlanFloatPaths` types. Also a conformance-matrix reconcile: the Start-On/Finish-On both-pass pin, the
  N11 zero-working-hour hang guard, the N16 lag-horizon cap, and the minute-granular baseline (S01) are
  confirmed in-engine and marked supported (their notes had gone stale after the M1 minute rework).

- [#91](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/91) [`a763a54`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/a763a5488370935dfaa44b6dc68198f2706270a4) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Resource **levelling** is now proven against the P6-class conformance fixture and its summary counts are
  surfaced on the HTTP schedule-summary (M7 levelling rung, ADR-0041 / ADR-0035 §28). The conformance
  adapter gains an opt-in `honorLevelling` demand-model build (capacity from `max_units_per_hour`, demand
  from every active assignment's `units_per_hour`); scenario **S10** runs as a runnable **leveled-date**
  differential (NL-CRANE600 A6100/A6200 + NL-HYDROPUMP A7700/A7730 serialise; mandatory A10100/A10500 are
  never moved) with the pure early/late/float layer byte-identical to S01 (Q2), plus a first-principles
  levelling golden. The `Resource levelling` capability row + S10 flip ✅ in the capability matrix, and
  ADR-0035 §28 (levelling semantics) + N21 (negative-capacity reject) are Accepted.

  The schedule summary (`PlanScheduleSummary` / `PlanScheduleSummaryDto`, both the recalculate result and
  the read endpoint) now carries `leveledActivityCount`, `levelingWindowExceededCount`,
  `selfOverAllocatedCount` and `leveledProjectFinish` — a read-time aggregate over the plan's engine-owned
  leveled columns, `0` / `null` when the plan does not level (`levelResources` off — the byte-identical
  parity path). Additive fields only; no behaviour change when levelling is off.

- [#91](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/91) [`7b29ccb`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/7b29ccb64208a29aed92836dc46bc35cb691a05b) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - L1 resource-levelling schema fields wired through the API (ADR-0041, the additive DARK slice). Threads
  the already-landed schema columns through `@repo/types`, the DTOs, and the service/repository write paths
  so they round-trip without changing any behaviour. Client-settable inputs: `resources.maxUnitsPerHour`
  (capacity ceiling, null = uncapped, N21 `@Min(0)`), `activities.levelingPriority` (levelling tie-break,
  null = unset), and the plan options `plans.levelResources` / `plans.levelWithinFloatOnly`. Engine-owned
  overlay (response-echo only, never accepted from a write DTO): `activities.leveledStart` /
  `leveledFinish`, `levelingDelayDays` (echoed from stored `levelingDelayMinutes`), `levelingWindowExceeded`,
  and `selfOverAllocated` — all null/false until the L2 levelling pass writes them. Fully additive and
  byte-parity: with levelling off (the default) nothing runs and every plan recalculates unchanged. The L2
  engine pass and L3 conformance follow.

- [#91](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/91) [`7952f5e`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/7952f5e1c60119ff7ffb31f34908e401dfc2731e) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - CPM engine now schedules **Level-of-Effort** activities (M5-epic F1–F2, ADR-0035 §21). An LOE is a
  hammock: its dates are derived from the span of its earliest SS-predecessor start to its latest
  FF-successor finish, in a post-pass after the network is computed. An LOE **never drives or bounds a
  neighbour, never appears on the critical path or the project-finish/longest-path sets, and never inherits
  negative float** (its late dates are pinned to its early dates, so total float and free float are a
  non-negative 0). An LOE with no resolvable span — missing an SS predecessor or an FF successor — is
  **produced at a defined fallback and flagged** (N12), never rejected: a new engine-owned
  `activities.loe_no_span` boolean, written by the recalc's batched write and exposed as `loeNoSpan` on the
  activity schedule response and the `ActivitySummary` shared type, with a plan-level `loeNoSpanCount` on
  the schedule summary. With no `LEVEL_OF_EFFORT` activity present the new pass is a no-op and the
  golden/parity path is byte-identical; existing rows read `false` until the plan is recalculated.

Adds an
  org-scoped `resources` library (a sibling of the calendar library: name, optional code, a
  `kind` enum LABOUR/EQUIPMENT/MATERIAL, an optional own `calendarId`) and a `resource_assignments`
  join (activity ↔ resource with `budgetedUnits` + an `isDriving` flag), plus a new `RESOURCE_DEPENDENT`
  `ActivityType` member and an engine-owned `resource_driver_missing` flag on `activities` (its writer is
  the M7.2 engine rung). DB invariants: partial-uniques enforce ≤1 driving assignment per activity and no
  duplicate active `(activity, resource)`; a CHECK backs the N14 non-negative-units reject. Fully additive
  and byte-parity — with no resource present, every existing plan recalculates unchanged. `@repo/types`
  mirrors the new `ActivityType` member. Schema + migration only; the resources module, assignment API,
  and §23 scheduling follow.

- [#91](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/91) [`62d7a97`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/62d7a974d752249fefa31ee7fea7e45e92a3e179) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - M7.1 resources module + resource-assignment API (ADR-0039, the resource dimension of the CPM engine).
  Adds an org-scoped resource library and the activity↔resource assignment join, mirroring the calendars
  module (soft-delete, cursor pagination, optimistic locking, deny-by-default RBAC + org scoping).

  New endpoints (all org-scoped): `POST/GET /organizations/:orgSlug/resources`,
  `GET/PATCH/DELETE /organizations/:orgSlug/resources/:resourceId`,
  `POST/GET /organizations/:orgSlug/activities/:activityId/assignments`, and
  `PATCH/DELETE /organizations/:orgSlug/assignments/:id`. New permissions: `resource:read` (every member)
  and `resource:create/update/delete/assign` (Planner + Org Admin only).

  Service-enforced invariants (ADR-0039): same-org for a resource's calendar and an assignment's
  activity/resource (the FK only scopes to the target table); `budgetedUnits` rejects negatives (N14);
  a resource in use by an active assignment can't be deleted (`RESOURCE_IN_USE`), and the existing
  `CALENDAR_IN_USE` guard now also counts resources; at most one driving assignment per activity — setting
  a driver is an in-transaction move; a `MATERIAL` resource may never drive. Adds the shared
  `ResourceKind` / `ResourceSummary` / `ResourceAssignmentSummary` types + a `RESOURCE_ERROR` map. The
  driving-resource-calendar scheduling (§23) and the `resource_driver_missing` writer follow in M7.2.

- [#93](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/93) [`481d063`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/481d063a2c65722901dc8f66d6d08d710a1f88a1) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Resource loading curves (M7 rung 5, ADR-0044 F3 / ADR-0035 §31) — **the final capability-matrix slice**.
  Each resource assignment gains a settable `curveType` (`UNIFORM` (default) / `BELL` / `FRONT_LOADED` /
  `BACK_LOADED` / `DOUBLE_PEAK`) — a named P6 loading curve — plus a new pure read-model
  (`resource-histogram.ts`) that distributes each assignment's `budgetedUnits` across its effective span
  (`start + assignment-lag → finish`, on the activity's own calendar, ADR-0037) per the named 21-point
  profile and aggregates a **units-over-time histogram per resource**, **conserving units** exactly
  (`Σ buckets === Σ budgetedUnits`). It moves **no CPM date**, owns **no engine column**, and does **NOT**
  feed the levelling pass this rung (Q2). `UNIFORM`/absent is a **flat** load — byte-identical to a
  flat-rate distribution — so the parity gate is trivial. `compute.ts` and `level.ts` are untouched.

  - **API (`@repo/api`)** — the create/update assignment DTOs, the assignment response DTO, and the
    assignment repository/service all carry `curveType` (reuses the existing `resource:assign` permission;
    a plain enum, not cost-gated). New `GET …/schedule/resource-histogram` endpoint (`schedule:read` — the
    units histogram is **schedule data, not cost**, Q5) with a `granularity` param (`DAY`/`WEEK`/`MONTH`)
    and offset paging over the per-resource series; the `meta` carries the shared bucket axis, series total,
    and `curveNormalisedCount` (N29). The new pure `computeResourceHistogram` read-model is a dependency-free
    sibling of `float-paths.ts` / `earned-value.ts`.
  - **Types (`@repo/types`)** — `ResourceCurveType` / `RESOURCE_CURVE_TYPES`, the histogram response types
    (`ResourceHistogram*`, `HistogramGranularity`), and `curveType` on `ResourceAssignmentSummary`.
  - **Conformance** — a new `resource-histogram-adapter.ts` reads the fixture's `resource_curves` +
    `assignments.curve`; the built-in profile constants are asserted **byte-equal to the fixture's
    profiles** (self-baselined, no external oracle, ADR-0034). Goldens prove **AS0026** (FRONT_LOADED,
    2400 u), **AS0042** (BACK_LOADED, 640 u), **AS0015** (BELL, 1200 u) and **AS0043** (DOUBLE_PEAK, 560 u)
    distribute to the exact profile shape and sum to `budgetedUnits`, plus a UNIFORM-vs-FRONT_LOADED
    differential (`resultsDiffer`), the assignment-lag case (**AS0027**), and **N29** (a profile not summing
    to 100 ⇒ normalise to the budget, units conserved, counted). The `res_curve_bell` /
    `res_curve_front_loaded` / `res_curve_back_loaded` / `res_curve_double_peak` capability tags flip ✅ —
    **closing the matrix (34 ✅ / 0 ⚪)**; ADR-0035 gains an **Accepted §31** + N29.
  - **Web (`@repo/web`)** — a **loading-curve picker** (Uniform / Bell / Front-loaded / Back-loaded /
    Double-peak) on the resource-assignment dialog and a **Resource histogram** read view (a bar chart with
    a keyboard-navigable data-table equivalent for WCAG 2.2 AA), behind the new **off-by-default**
    `VITE_RESOURCE_CURVES` flag; the picker round-trips through the assignment create/update mutation.

- [#91](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/91) [`afd4690`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/afd4690ed6832ff43b4e551e530346bbaaaaec68) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - CPM engine now schedules **resource-dependent** activities on their driving resource's calendar (M7.2,
  ADR-0035 §23 / ADR-0039). When a `RESOURCE_DEPENDENT` activity has a driving resource assignment, the
  schedule service resolves the activity's calendar port to that **resource's** calendar before the pass
  runs (fallback chain: driving-resource calendar → the activity's own calendar → the plan default); the
  engine then treats the activity exactly like a `TASK` for logic, so its duration advances and its float
  is measured on the resource's calendar. A `RESOURCE_DEPENDENT` activity with **no** driving assignment is
  **produced at the fallback calendar and flagged** (§23), never dropped: a new engine-owned
  `activities.resource_driver_missing` boolean, written by the recalc's batched write and exposed as
  `resourceDriverMissing` on the activity schedule response and the `ActivitySummary` shared type, with a
  plan-level `resourceDriverMissingCount` on the schedule summary. With no `RESOURCE_DEPENDENT` activity
  present the resolution is skipped entirely and the golden/parity path is byte-identical; existing rows
  read `false` until the plan is recalculated.

- [#91](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/91) [`7074b77`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/7074b7703ff1b9bf784676a87c5a692a49741bc6) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - WBS activity hierarchy foundation (M5-epic F5, ADR-0038 / ADR-0035 §24). Activities gain an adjacency-list
  `parentId` (a nullable self-reference) and a new `WBS_SUMMARY` activity type, the groundwork for
  WBS-summary rollup. The create/update API accepts `parentId` and the response echoes it; the service
  validates it is an **active `WBS_SUMMARY` in the same plan** (a foreign/cross-plan/deleted id reads as 404) and that re-parenting introduces **no cycle** in the WBS tree. A **WBS summary carries no logic**:
  the dependency-create path rejects a link whose endpoint is a summary (422). Governed by the new ADR-0038
  (adjacency-list over a materialised path; parent tree acyclic + same-plan, orthogonal to the dependency
  DAG). Schema-only + validation — the rollup engine (F6) and flagged web surface (F8) follow; every
  existing activity reads `parentId = null`, so the path is behaviour-preserving.

- [#93](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/93) [`481d063`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/481d063a2c65722901dc8f66d6d08d710a1f88a1) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Weighted activity steps (M7 rung 5, ADR-0044 F2 / ADR-0035 §33). An activity gains a **weighted progress
  step checklist** (`activity_steps` child table — `seq` / `name` / `weight` / `percentComplete`) whose
  weight-weighted mean `Σ(w·p)/Σw` becomes the activity's **PHYSICAL** %-complete and **wins** over the
  manual `physicalPercentComplete` when steps are present. Steps feed the ADR-0042 `PHYSICAL` Earned-Value
  measure only — they **never change a CPM date**; with no steps the manual field stands exactly (the
  byte-identical parity path, so the existing EV goldens stay green). The engine (`compute.ts`) and the
  levelling pass (`level.ts`) are untouched; the pure resolver already in `earned-value.ts`
  (`rollupPhysicalPercent`) is unchanged — this change only adds layers around it.

  - **API (`@repo/api`)** — a steps sub-resource following the reference-template layering
    (controller → service → repository, deny-by-default, org-scoped): `GET …/activities/:activityId/steps`
    (list active, seq-ordered) and `PUT …/activities/:activityId/steps` (`{ version, steps: [...] }`
    bulk-replace, Q3) — retained rows updated in place, new ones appended, removed ones soft-deleted, the
    server assigns `seq`, and the parent **activity's** `version` is optimistic-locked (stale ⇒ 409). Reuses
    `activity:update` (a step is activity-write) — no new permission. **N28** (a step `percentComplete`
    outside 0–100 ⇒ 422 `STEP_PERCENT_OUT_OF_RANGE`) and a negative `weight` are DTO-boundary rejects,
    backstopped by DB CHECKs. The EV read (`schedule.service.getEarnedValue` + `loadEarnedValueActivities`)
    loads each activity's active steps into the `PHYSICAL` rollup and reports a plan-level
    **`stepWeightZeroCount`** (N27 — all-zero-weight ⇒ manual fallback, never a divide-by-zero), mirroring
    `costWarningCount`. The soft-delete cascade is wired into `HierarchyLifecycleService` (steps sweep and
    restore with their activity under the same `delete_batch_id`, both directions).
  - **Types (`@repo/types`)** — new `ActivityStep`, `ActivityStepInput`, `ReplaceActivityStepsRequest`;
    `PlanEarnedValue` gains `stepWeightZeroCount`.
  - **Conformance** — the EV adapter reads the fixture's `steps` and attaches them to A4200 / A7100; new
    goldens assert the weighted-mean rollup **A4200 → 35.0005%** (the fixture's own
    `prog_rd_vs_pct_divergence` — steps-physical ≠ its 40% duration-%) and **A7100 → 0%**, a
    steps-present-vs-manual differential (`resultsDiffer`), and the N27 fallback + count. **N28** is
    DTO-tested. The `code_steps` capability tag flips ✅ (33 ✅ / 1 ⚪ — only resource curves remain);
    ADR-0035 gains an **Accepted §33** + N27/N28.
  - **Web (`@repo/web`)** — an `ActivityStepsEditor` (editable name / weight / %-complete rows with
    add/remove/reorder) opened from the activities table row menu behind the new **off-by-default**
    `VITE_ACTIVITY_STEPS` flag, showing the rolled-up physical % and a "steps override the manual %" note,
    wired to the bulk-PUT mutation (TanStack Query).

  Deferred (the last ADR-0044 slice, not in this change): **resource loading curves** (F3), the one
  remaining ⚪ capability row.

- [#89](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/89) [`a283c0c`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/a283c0c2064e48b531e35cc911be018696275d3a) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - CPM engine now computes **free float** (M6-F1, ADR-0035 §17–§20): how far each activity can slip without
  delaying the early start of any successor. It is measured on the activity's own working calendar
  (ADR-0037 §4), computed alongside total float, persisted to the new engine-owned `activities.free_float`
  column by the recalc's batched write, and exposed as `freeFloat` (whole working days) on the activity
  schedule response and the `ActivitySummary` shared type. An open end (no successors) carries its total
  float; free float is always ≤ total float. Existing rows read `null` until the plan is recalculated, and
  the golden/parity path is byte-identical.

- [#89](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/89) [`a283c0c`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/a283c0c2064e48b531e35cc911be018696275d3a) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Selectable critical-path definition (M6-F2, ADR-0035 §17–§20). Plans gain two options:
  `criticalPathDefinition` (`TOTAL_FLOAT`, the P6 default, or `LONGEST_PATH`) and `criticalFloatThreshold`
  (whole working days, default 0). Under `LONGEST_PATH` the engine flags the contiguous chain of driving
  ties running back from the latest-finishing activities, so an open-ended, hugely-negative-float activity
  is no longer critical though it is under `TOTAL_FLOAT ≤ 0`. The threshold widens the total-float critical
  band. Both are echoed on the plan response and accepted on plan update; defaults are behaviour-preserving
  (the golden path and existing critical sets are unchanged). Conformance scenario **S07** now runs as a
  criticality-only differential.

- [#89](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/89) [`a283c0c`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/a283c0c2064e48b531e35cc911be018696275d3a) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Make-open-ends-critical option (M6-F4, ADR-0035 §20). A new plan flag `makeOpenEndsCritical` (default
  off) flags every open-ended activity — one with no predecessors or no successors — as critical, OR-ed
  with the active critical definition so it only ever adds open ends, never a mid-chain member. It is
  threaded through recalculation, echoed on the plan response, and accepted on plan update. Default off
  is behaviour-preserving (existing critical sets unchanged). Conformance scenario **S08** now runs as a
  criticality-only differential.

- [#89](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/89) [`a283c0c`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/a283c0c2064e48b531e35cc911be018696275d3a) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Selectable total-float measure (M6-F3, ADR-0035 §18). A new plan option `totalFloatMode`
  (`FINISH` — the P6 default — `START`, or `SMALLEST`) chooses how `totalFloat` is measured: late−early
  finish, late−early start, or the lesser. It is computed on the activity's own working calendar,
  threaded through recalculation, echoed on the plan response, and accepted on plan update; the default
  `FINISH` is behaviour-preserving (existing float is byte-identical).

  Documented semantic: because float is measured on the activity's own calendar for both sides
  (ADR-0037 §4), the three modes coincide for unprogressed activities and diverge only for progressed
  ones — so the conformance fixture's mixed-calendar S13 divergence is deliberately not reproduced (a
  P6 multi-calendar-measurement artefact; see the capability matrix and ADR-0035 §18).

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [#86](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/86) [`a4ff745`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/a4ff745def49f3ff70b463cd48884c16ad72bedb) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Add **Expected Finish** scheduling (M4-F5, ADR-0035 §9). A new per-activity `expectedFinish` target
  date plus a plan-level `useExpectedFinishDates` option: when the option is on, the CPM forward pass
  **recomputes** an in-progress activity's remaining work so its early finish lands on its expected
  finish (the day's working-end boundary), floored at the rescheduled start — a past target collapses the
  remaining to zero. When the option is off, or for a not-started/complete activity, the target is
  ignored and the schedule is byte-identical to the pure-progress path.

  `expectedFinish` is client-settable on the activity create/update DTOs and exposed on the activity
  response + shared `ActivitySummary`; `useExpectedFinishDates` is set via `UpdatePlanDto` and exposed on
  the plan response + shared `Plan` type, threaded through the recalculate contract like the progress
  recalc mode. The recalc log carries an `expectedFinishAppliedCount`. Two additive columns (a nullable
  activity date and a defaulted plan boolean) — no data migration; the golden suite is unchanged. The
  conformance golden (A6200) and the S12 on/off differential land with the F6 conformance slice.

- [#86](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/86) [`a4ff745`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/a4ff745def49f3ff70b463cd48884c16ad72bedb) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Mandatory constraints now **produce-and-flag** instead of being silently parked (M4-F2, ADR-0035 §7).
  `MANDATORY_START`/`MANDATORY_FINISH` still pin their date with the same MSO/MFO arithmetic, but when a
  pin drives an activity earlier than its logic allows the engine now **produces the (impossible)
  schedule as pinned and flags it** — a new engine-owned `constraintViolated` boolean on each activity —
  surfacing the broken relationship as negative float on the predecessor, and never repairing it. A pin
  the network can satisfy is not flagged.

  The schedule summary's dishonest `parkedConstraintCount` is **replaced** by two honest counts:
  `constraintViolationCount` (mandatory pins that broke logic) and `constraintWarningCount` (the N15 case
  — a Start-No-Earlier-Than dated before the data date, honoured but unable to pull work back). The
  recalc response, read summary, and structured recalc log all carry the new counts; the summary strip
  shows "Constraint conflicts" / "Constraint warnings" figures with accessible explanations in place of
  the old "Parked constraints" figure. Plans with no mandatory constraints are byte-identical (the
  golden suite is unchanged) and report both counts as zero.

- [#86](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/86) [`a4ff745`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/a4ff745def49f3ff70b463cd48884c16ad72bedb) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Activities can now be flagged **Schedule As-Late-As-Possible** (M4-F4, ADR-0035 §11). The new
  `scheduleAsLateAsPossible` boolean is a **display-only** placement preference: a flagged activity is
  rendered at its late-based position (its already-computed late dates), while the pure
  `early*`/`late*`/`totalFloat` schedule stays a pure function of the network — it is never a date
  constraint. The zero-**free**-float refinement (place only as late as successors allow) lands in M6;
  until then the late-based position is the render target.

  The flag is client-settable via the create/update DTOs, exposed read-only on the activity response and
  the shared `ActivitySummary`, threaded into the engine seam, and read on the recalc load. Additive,
  defaulted column — no data migration; the golden suite is unchanged (a new A9400-style golden pins the
  non-interference contract). The on-canvas editor for the flag is a later slice.

- [#86](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/86) [`a4ff745`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/a4ff745def49f3ff70b463cd48884c16ad72bedb) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Activities can now carry a **secondary schedule constraint** (M4-F3, ADR-0035 §10). The primary
  constraint drives the forward pass (early dates) as before; the new
  `secondaryConstraintType`/`secondaryConstraintDate` pair drives the backward pass (late dates) — the
  canonical pairing is a forward primary + a backward secondary (e.g. an SNET that moves the early start
  plus an FNLT that tightens the late finish). A secondary of a forward-only kind (SNET/FNET) is a
  documented no-op on the backward clamp, and an activity with no secondary is scheduled byte-identically
  (the golden suite is unchanged).

  The pair is client-settable via the create/update DTOs with the same both-or-neither pairing rule as
  the primary (mirrored by a DB CHECK constraint), exposed read-only on the activity response and the
  shared `ActivitySummary`, and read on the recalc load. Additive, nullable columns — no data migration.

- [#84](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/84) [`3111809`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/3111809cb46eb8c51848493ff6837dad6f717fbd) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Plan-level progress recalc mode (M2, ADR-0035 §1). Plans now carry a
  `progressRecalcMode` — `RETAINED_LOGIC` (default), `PROGRESS_OVERRIDE`, or
  `ACTUAL_DATES` — exposed on the plan response and settable via `PATCH` (like
  `schedulingMode`), and threaded into the CPM recalculation. It governs how an
  in-progress activity's remaining work treats predecessor logic when progress is
  out of sequence. Behaviour-preserving by default; an unprogressed plan is
  unaffected.

- [#84](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/84) [`3111809`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/3111809cb46eb8c51848493ff6837dad6f717fbd) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Progress ingestion web controls (M2, ADR-0035), behind `VITE_PROGRESS_INGESTION`
  (off by default). When enabled:

  - The progress editor gains a **remaining duration** input (blank derives it from
    percent complete) plus **suspend / resume** dates for a paused activity — with
    client-side validation mirroring the API (resume ≥ suspend).
  - Plan settings gain a **recalc mode** picker — Retained Logic / Progress Override
    / Actual Dates — persisted with a targeted PATCH and applied on the next
    recalculation.

  The activity read model now exposes `remainingDurationDays`, `suspendDate`, and
  `resumeDate` (`@repo/types` + the activity response DTO), so the editor seeds and
  round-trips a stored value even with the inputs hidden. The engine, the settable
  API fields, and the plan recalc-mode column were already live; this slice only
  adds the flag-gated authoring UI.

- [#85](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/85) [`399afc8`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/399afc8893dd2f50441a0a922edf3571961beab8) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Surface progress-repair warnings and clarify the progress editor (M2 follow-up,
  ADR-0035 §6).

  - The progress endpoint (`PATCH …/activities/:id/progress`) now returns
    `meta.warnings` (a `ProgressWarning[]`) when it repairs a complete activity —
    `COMPLETE_WITHOUT_FINISH` (finish set to the data date) or
    `REMAINING_ON_COMPLETE` (remaining forced to zero). The write still succeeds and
    `data` reflects the corrected value; an ordinary report omits `meta`. Adds a
    reusable single-resource `ResourceEnvelope` for `{ data, meta }` responses.
  - The web progress editor announces those repairs on save, and a note makes clear
    the remaining/suspend/resume fields reschedule the remaining work rather than
    change the derived status.

- [#82](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/82) [`f382196`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/f382196bc0d38fceec1938e8a30f5504389708ec) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Per-activity working-time calendars (M5, ADR-0037). Each activity can now carry its own
  `calendarId` (create/update/response API + shared `ActivitySummary`) — `null` inherits the plan
  default. The CPM engine moved to an **absolute working-instant** axis so each activity's duration,
  float, and dates are measured on **its own** calendar: a 24/7 commissioning activity inside a 5-day
  plan works across weekends, and a relationship's `PREDECESSOR`/`SUCCESSOR` lag now resolves to the
  endpoint activity's calendar (completing M3's forward-wiring). A plan where every activity inherits
  the plan calendar recalculates **byte-identically** (the golden suite is the parity gate). The
  activity calendar is validated in-org under the calendar advisory lock (like the plan picker), and
  the recalculation resolves each distinct calendar once (O(distinct calendars), not O(activities)).

Dependencies gain a `lagCalendar`
  field (`PREDECESSOR` / `SUCCESSOR` / `TWENTY_FOUR_HOUR` / `PROJECT_DEFAULT`, default
  `PROJECT_DEFAULT`) exposed on the create/update/response API, with a lag-calendar selector
  on the dependency editor (and a lag-calendar label in the Logic panel's link lists). The CPM
  engine now measures each edge's lag on that calendar: `TWENTY_FOUR_HOUR` schedules the lag as
  **elapsed** time (e.g. concrete cure's `168h` = 7 elapsed days, not 7 working days), while the
  other three coincide with the plan calendar today (Predecessor/Successor become distinct once
  per-activity calendars land in M5). The default path is unchanged — a plan with no 24-Hour
  lag recalculates byte-identically.

### Minor Changes

- [#65](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/65) [`5e4e1a8`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/5e4e1a88b56e6e561102d80129a711ecdcaeec8c) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - feat: scheduling modes — mandatory project start + Visual planning (ADR-0033)

  Delivers ADR-0033's scheduling model. The **mandatory project start (M1)** is a live product
  change; the **Visual-planning surface (M2–M4)** ships behind the default-off `VITE_SCHEDULING_MODES`
  flag until enablement.

  **M1 — Mandatory project start (live):**

  - A plan can no longer exist without a start date. A backfill+NOT-NULL migration sets
    `plans.planned_start` for existing plans (CQ-6 chain: earliest active constraint date → actual
    start → creation day) and makes the column NOT NULL. `CreatePlanDto.plannedStart` is required (422
    without); `UpdatePlanDto` rejects an explicit `null` (the data date can be moved, never cleared).
    The web plan form requires it, and the ADR-0032 "first draw anchors to today" hack is gone.

  **M2–M4 — Visual planning (behind `VITE_SCHEDULING_MODES`):**

  - A plan-level `schedulingMode` (**Early** = computed-earliest CPM, **Visual** = hand-placed) with a
    toolbar mode selector, and a Planner-owned `Activity.visualStart` placement input fed through the
    engine's second, forward-only effective-Visual pass (placements pin the bar and push unplaced
    successors; the pure-network pass still owns early/late/float).
  - A Visual-mode canvas drag hand-places `visualStart` (no implicit SNET constraint); Early mode keeps
    the SNET path. Engine-owned conflict flags surface as an on-canvas warning triangle (shape, not
    colour-only) with a spoken read-out — placements are flagged, never auto-moved.
  - Navigation/data split: a "Go to date" view jump distinct from the persisted "Project start" anchor.
  - A read-only **Late-start overlay** renders bars from the late dates for float analysis (editing
    suppressed while on).

  Flag-off, the TSLD renders exactly as before.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#41](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/41) [`32e843f`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/32e843f4136460aa403c26ef45ac4496c82d1f6b) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Close the "date constraints" loop in the UI. The activity form's constraint
  selector now offers only the **six** kinds the CPM engine honours exactly as
  labelled (`SNET`/`SNLT`/`FNET`/`FNLT`/`MSO`/`MFO`); the two `MANDATORY_*` kinds —
  which the engine silently parks as their moderate equivalents (ADR-0023 §6) — are
  no longer newly selectable, so a planner can't set a constraint that behaves
  differently than it reads. An activity that already carries a parked value keeps it
  as an honest, spelled-out option ("Mandatory start — applied as Must start on") and
  is **never silently changed** on open.

  A set constraint is now visible without opening each row: a text **Constraint**
  column in the activities table (`"SNET · 01 May 2026"`, with the full label as its
  accessible name), a small **pin** on the constrained edge of a bar on the TSLD
  canvas (a shape cue, not colour — with a legend entry and a spoken equivalent in the
  diagram's accessible listbox), and an explanation of the "Parked constraints" figure
  in the schedule summary.

  `@repo/types` gains `SELECTABLE_CONSTRAINT_TYPES` / `PARKED_CONSTRAINT_TYPES` /
  `isParkedConstraintType` (the honoured-as-labelled set, mirroring the engine). No
  API, database, or engine change — the constraint write path, optimistic locking, and
  pen gating are untouched.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/35) [`76b9041`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/76b9041c995eab9ee711082baf74dbd06cdb6263) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Add the server core of the single-editor **plan edit-lock** (ADR-0028) — the last precondition to
  enabling the built TSLD editing surface. A new `PlanLock` lease (heartbeat + TTL with explicit
  release; presence = held, absence = free) backs an `edit-lock` sub-resource under a plan:
  GET status, POST acquire (with `takeover`), POST heartbeat, POST request, POST handoff, and DELETE
  release. Lock-precondition failures return a new **423 Locked** (`code: "LOCKED"`), distinct from the
  409 optimistic conflict, with a machine-readable `reason`
  (`PLAN_EDIT_LOCK_REQUIRED | PLAN_EDIT_LOCK_HELD | PLAN_EDIT_LOCK_LOST`). The holder grain is the
  **user** (re-entrant across tabs), and any Planner can **request control** of a live lock and take
  over after a grace window — or immediately if the holder has gone inactive — while an Org Admin can
  override immediately; acquire/request/hand-off/take-over serialise under the existing plan advisory
  lock. New permissions `plan:acquire_lock` / `plan:request_control` (Planner + Org Admin) and
  `plan:override_lock` (Org Admin). `@repo/types` gains the `PlanEditLockStatus` / `PlanEditLockActor`
  contracts and the `PLAN_EDIT_LOCK_*` reason union. No UI yet and no endpoint is pen-gated in this
  slice — inert until the front end and the write-gate land; `main` stays releasable.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#24](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/24) [`300f386`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/300f38685578f1bc432c9b48051f58bc10c22883) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Add the baseline schema and permissions (M7, ADR-0025). New `baselines` and
  `baseline_activities` tables: a baseline is a named, frozen snapshot of a plan's
  schedule (the plan of record), and each `baseline_activities` row is a **self-contained
  copy** of an activity's identity and captured CPM dates — `source_activity_id` is a
  plain correlation UUID with **no foreign key**, so a baseline survives the source
  activities' 90-day hard purge and stays faithful even if a live activity is edited or
  deleted. A partial unique `uq_baselines_plan_active` guarantees **at most one active
  baseline per plan** in the database (not just in code); `uq_baselines_plan_name` keeps
  names unique per plan among live rows; both tables carry soft delete + batch restore and
  the documented scoped indexes (the `(baseline_id, source_activity_id)` index is the
  variance join key). Adds the `baseline:read` / `baseline:create` / `baseline:activate` /
  `baseline:delete` permissions (read for every member; write for Planner + Org Admin) and
  the shared `@repo/types` `BaselineSummary` / `BaselineDetail` / `BaselineActivitySnapshot`
  / `BaselineVarianceRow` / `PlanVarianceSummary` contracts. Schema and permissions only —
  the baselines module, variance read model, and web surface land next.

New `calendars`
  and `calendar_exceptions` tables: an org-scoped calendar is a 7-bit `working_weekdays`
  mask (Monday…Sunday) plus dated exceptions (holidays / worked weekends), with a
  `working_weekdays > 0 AND <= 127` CHECK, partial-unique names/exception-dates among
  live rows, soft delete + batch restore, and the documented indexes (the active
  `(calendar_id, date)` unique doubles as the engine's exception load). Adds the
  `calendar:read` / `calendar:create` / `calendar:update` / `calendar:delete` permissions
  (read for every member; write for Planner + Org Admin) and the shared `@repo/types`
  `Calendar`/`CalendarException` shapes plus a pure `WorkingWeekdays` bitmask helper (the
  single source of truth the API DTO validates against and the web toggle group binds to).
  Schema and permissions only — the CRUD module and engine wiring land next.

- [#22](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/22) [`5756fa0`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/5756fa0932f7b45ba71a3ae30ee20ef996404a14) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Wire calendars into plans (M5 Task C1, ADR-0024). Plans gain a nullable
  `calendar_id` (FK to calendars, RESTRICT, partial-indexed); a null calendar means
  all-days-work (M6 back-compat). Each organisation is seeded a **Standard (Mon–Fri)**
  calendar — on org create and backfilled for existing orgs by the migration — and new
  plans default to it. A Planner can assign a plan's calendar via `PATCH plans/:id`
  (`calendarId`, validated to be an active calendar in the same organisation — a
  foreign/unknown id is a 404, indistinguishable from missing; null clears it), and a
  calendar referenced by an active plan can no longer be deleted (409 `CALENDAR_IN_USE`).
  Calendar assignment and the delete-in-use guard serialise on a calendar-scoped advisory
  lock, so a plan can never be assigned a calendar that is being deleted. `Plan.calendarId` is added to `@repo/types` and the plan
  response. Recalculation still ignores the calendar until Task C2 wires it into the
  engine.

/organizations/:orgSlug/plans/:planId/schedule/summary` (permission
  `schedule:read`, every member) returns a plan's computed schedule roll-up from a
  single aggregate over the persisted engine columns — no recompute. It returns the
  identical `PlanScheduleSummary` shape as recalculate (data date, project finish,
  activity/critical/near-critical/parked counts), now a shared type in `@repo/types`.
  Null-safe for a never-calculated plan (null finish) and a plan with no start date
  (null data date).

New
  `dependency:*` permission codes follow the hierarchy rule — `dependency:read` for
  every member, `dependency:create/update/delete` for Planner + Org Admin only
  (deliberately not Contributor). `@repo/types` gains the `DEPENDENCY_TYPES` const
  (FS/SS/FF/SF, source-of-truth kept in lock-step with the API's Prisma enum) and
  the `DependencySummary`/`DependencyEndpoint` contracts the dependency API and web
  logic editor agree on. Documentation: ADR-0021 records the DAG invariant and the
  service-layer cycle-prevention strategy; DECISIONS.md records the permission
  namespace and link cascade/restore behaviour.

### Patch Changes

- [#10](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/10) [`a3e9e01`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/a3e9e01d4684f945b48cd116374a545d39a7f9bc) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Fix `@repo/types` so it resolves under classic `tsc` without a prior build.
  Its top-level `types` field pointed at `./dist/index.d.ts`, but the API compiles
  with `moduleResolution: "Node"`, which ignores `exports` and reads that field —
  so any `tsc` run outside Turbo's `^build` graph (the `verify-template.sh`
  type-check and the e2e Playwright web server) failed with `TS2307` because
  `dist/` had not been built. The field now points at `./src/index.ts`, so
  type-checking resolves from source everywhere; the Node runtime is unaffected
  because it resolves the `exports.default` condition to `./dist/index.js`.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#8](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/8) [`cfe1d24`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/cfe1d2485ff2d1b8deeaf4328c5691754c91da40) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Fix the API container crashing on boot with `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING`.
  `@repo/types` shipped raw TypeScript (its `exports` pointed at `src/index.ts`),
  which tools transpile but plain Node cannot load — so the production image
  crashed when the compiled API `require`d it. `@repo/types` now builds to
  `dist/` (ESM + declarations) and its `exports` resolve to the compiled output at
  runtime, while the `development`/`types` conditions still point at source so
  dev, tests, and typecheck are unchanged. The API and web Docker builds compile
  `@repo/types` before the app, and `turbo dev` depends on it too.

### Minor Changes

- [#2](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/2) [`56a82ca`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/56a82ca5fe650a70f0792d5b31f66dd964be92bf) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Add organisation invitations and a transactional-mail port. Org Admins can
  invite by email with a role (`POST /organizations/:orgSlug/invitations`), list
  pending invites, and revoke them; invitees preview by token
  (`POST /invitations/preview`) and accept (`POST /invitations/accept`) to join.
  Tokens are stored hashed (raw value returned once + emailed), invitations expire,
  and accept is transactional. Adds a `MailService` port with a logging stub
  adapter (the accept URL is also returned so onboarding works without a provider)
  and the shared `InvitationSummary`/`InvitationPreview` contracts to `@repo/types`.
  Introduces a `410 Gone` error for expired/revoked invitations.

- [#2](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/2) [`56a82ca`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/56a82ca5fe650a70f0792d5b31f66dd964be92bf) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Add the organisations tenancy core. New `Organization` and `OrgMember` models
  (the canonical org-scoping foundation: UUID v7, soft-delete, audit, optimistic
  locking, partial-unique slug and one-membership-per-user indexes) and the
  `organizations` module: `POST /api/v1/organizations` (creator becomes Org Admin,
  atomically, with slug uniquification), `GET /api/v1/organizations` (the caller's
  orgs), and `GET /api/v1/organizations/:orgSlug` (404 for non-members —
  anti-enumeration). The auth seam now hydrates a principal's memberships and
  permissions from the database, so `/api/v1/me` returns real memberships and
  `principal.can(permission, orgId)` is enforced. Adds the shared
  `OrganizationSummary` contract to `@repo/types`.

- [#2](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/2) [`56a82ca`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/56a82ca5fe650a70f0792d5b31f66dd964be92bf) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Add membership management. New endpoints under the organisation scope:
  `GET /api/v1/organizations/:orgSlug/members` (cursor-paginated roster with user
  profiles), `PATCH .../members/:memberId` (change role, Org Admin only, with
  optimistic locking and the last-Org-Admin invariant), and
  `DELETE .../members/:memberId` (soft-delete, Org Admin only, last-admin
  protected). Every route resolves the org scope from the caller's memberships
  (404 for non-members; 403 for insufficient role). Adds the shared
  `OrgMemberSummary` contract to `@repo/types`.

- [#2](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/2) [`56a82ca`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/56a82ca5fe650a70f0792d5b31f66dd964be92bf) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Wire up authentication and the current-user endpoint (walking skeleton). Mounts
  Better Auth (`/api/auth/*`, email + password, cookie sessions) behind the
  `AuthContextService` seam, adds the identity tables (`users`, `sessions`,
  `accounts`, `verifications`) as the first migration, and exposes an
  authenticated `GET /api/v1/me` returning the signed-in user and their
  organisation memberships. Adds the shared `MeResponse` / `SessionUser` /
  `OrganizationRole` contracts to `@repo/types`.
