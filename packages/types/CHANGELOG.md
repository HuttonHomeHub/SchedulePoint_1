# @repo/types

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#41](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/41) [`32e843f`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/32e843f4136460aa403c26ef45ac4496c82d1f6b) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Close the "date constraints" loop in the UI. The activity form's constraint
  selector now offers only the **six** kinds the CPM engine honours exactly as
  labelled (`SNET`/`SNLT`/`FNET`/`FNLT`/`MSO`/`MFO`); the two `MANDATORY_*` kinds —
  which the engine silently parks as their moderate equivalents (ADR-0023 §6) — are
  no longer newly selectable, so a planner can't set a constraint that behaves
  differently than it reads. An activity that already carries a parked value keeps it
  as an honest, spelled-out option ("Mandatory start — applied as Must start on") and
  is **never silently changed** on open.

  A set constraint is now visible without opening each row: a text **Constraint**
  column in the activities table (`"SNET · 01 May 2026"`, with the full label as its
  accessible name), a small **pin** on the constrained edge of a bar on the TSLD
  canvas (a shape cue, not colour — with a legend entry and a spoken equivalent in the
  diagram's accessible listbox), and an explanation of the "Parked constraints" figure
  in the schedule summary.

  `@repo/types` gains `SELECTABLE_CONSTRAINT_TYPES` / `PARKED_CONSTRAINT_TYPES` /
  `isParkedConstraintType` (the honoured-as-labelled set, mirroring the engine). No
  API, database, or engine change — the constraint write path, optimistic locking, and
  pen gating are untouched.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/35) [`76b9041`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/76b9041c995eab9ee711082baf74dbd06cdb6263) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Add the server core of the single-editor **plan edit-lock** (ADR-0028) — the last precondition to
  enabling the built TSLD editing surface. A new `PlanLock` lease (heartbeat + TTL with explicit
  release; presence = held, absence = free) backs an `edit-lock` sub-resource under a plan:
  GET status, POST acquire (with `takeover`), POST heartbeat, POST request, POST handoff, and DELETE
  release. Lock-precondition failures return a new **423 Locked** (`code: "LOCKED"`), distinct from the
  409 optimistic conflict, with a machine-readable `reason`
  (`PLAN_EDIT_LOCK_REQUIRED | PLAN_EDIT_LOCK_HELD | PLAN_EDIT_LOCK_LOST`). The holder grain is the
  **user** (re-entrant across tabs), and any Planner can **request control** of a live lock and take
  over after a grace window — or immediately if the holder has gone inactive — while an Org Admin can
  override immediately; acquire/request/hand-off/take-over serialise under the existing plan advisory
  lock. New permissions `plan:acquire_lock` / `plan:request_control` (Planner + Org Admin) and
  `plan:override_lock` (Org Admin). `@repo/types` gains the `PlanEditLockStatus` / `PlanEditLockActor`
  contracts and the `PLAN_EDIT_LOCK_*` reason union. No UI yet and no endpoint is pen-gated in this
  slice — inert until the front end and the write-gate land; `main` stays releasable.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#24](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/24) [`300f386`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/300f38685578f1bc432c9b48051f58bc10c22883) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Add the baseline schema and permissions (M7, ADR-0025). New `baselines` and
  `baseline_activities` tables: a baseline is a named, frozen snapshot of a plan's
  schedule (the plan of record), and each `baseline_activities` row is a **self-contained
  copy** of an activity's identity and captured CPM dates — `source_activity_id` is a
  plain correlation UUID with **no foreign key**, so a baseline survives the source
  activities' 90-day hard purge and stays faithful even if a live activity is edited or
  deleted. A partial unique `uq_baselines_plan_active` guarantees **at most one active
  baseline per plan** in the database (not just in code); `uq_baselines_plan_name` keeps
  names unique per plan among live rows; both tables carry soft delete + batch restore and
  the documented scoped indexes (the `(baseline_id, source_activity_id)` index is the
  variance join key). Adds the `baseline:read` / `baseline:create` / `baseline:activate` /
  `baseline:delete` permissions (read for every member; write for Planner + Org Admin) and
  the shared `@repo/types` `BaselineSummary` / `BaselineDetail` / `BaselineActivitySnapshot`
  / `BaselineVarianceRow` / `PlanVarianceSummary` contracts. Schema and permissions only —
  the baselines module, variance read model, and web surface land next.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#22](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/22) [`5756fa0`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/5756fa0932f7b45ba71a3ae30ee20ef996404a14) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Add the working-day calendar schema and permissions (M5, ADR-0024). New `calendars`
  and `calendar_exceptions` tables: an org-scoped calendar is a 7-bit `working_weekdays`
  mask (Monday…Sunday) plus dated exceptions (holidays / worked weekends), with a
  `working_weekdays > 0 AND <= 127` CHECK, partial-unique names/exception-dates among
  live rows, soft delete + batch restore, and the documented indexes (the active
  `(calendar_id, date)` unique doubles as the engine's exception load). Adds the
  `calendar:read` / `calendar:create` / `calendar:update` / `calendar:delete` permissions
  (read for every member; write for Planner + Org Admin) and the shared `@repo/types`
  `Calendar`/`CalendarException` shapes plus a pure `WorkingWeekdays` bitmask helper (the
  single source of truth the API DTO validates against and the web toggle group binds to).
  Schema and permissions only — the CRUD module and engine wiring land next.

- [#22](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/22) [`5756fa0`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/5756fa0932f7b45ba71a3ae30ee20ef996404a14) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Wire calendars into plans (M5 Task C1, ADR-0024). Plans gain a nullable
  `calendar_id` (FK to calendars, RESTRICT, partial-indexed); a null calendar means
  all-days-work (M6 back-compat). Each organisation is seeded a **Standard (Mon–Fri)**
  calendar — on org create and backfilled for existing orgs by the migration — and new
  plans default to it. A Planner can assign a plan's calendar via `PATCH plans/:id`
  (`calendarId`, validated to be an active calendar in the same organisation — a
  foreign/unknown id is a 404, indistinguishable from missing; null clears it), and a
  calendar referenced by an active plan can no longer be deleted (409 `CALENDAR_IN_USE`).
  Calendar assignment and the delete-in-use guard serialise on a calendar-scoped advisory
  lock, so a plan can never be assigned a calendar that is being deleted. `Plan.calendarId` is added to `@repo/types` and the plan
  response. Recalculation still ignores the calendar until Task C2 wires it into the
  engine.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#20](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/20) [`9f614f2`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/9f614f22d9e233fb4783c4c81bc01bb9cc5b398c) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Add the read-side schedule summary: `GET
/organizations/:orgSlug/plans/:planId/schedule/summary` (permission
  `schedule:read`, every member) returns a plan's computed schedule roll-up from a
  single aggregate over the persisted engine columns — no recompute. It returns the
  identical `PlanScheduleSummary` shape as recalculate (data date, project finish,
  activity/critical/near-critical/parked counts), now a shared type in `@repo/types`.
  Null-safe for a never-calculated plan (null finish) and a plan with no start date
  (null data date).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#18](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/18) [`7a8ebba`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/7a8ebba2b1fe336b9d1e0c95ef302da80db840c6) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Add the activity-dependency authorisation and contract foundation (ADR-0021). New
  `dependency:*` permission codes follow the hierarchy rule — `dependency:read` for
  every member, `dependency:create/update/delete` for Planner + Org Admin only
  (deliberately not Contributor). `@repo/types` gains the `DEPENDENCY_TYPES` const
  (FS/SS/FF/SF, source-of-truth kept in lock-step with the API's Prisma enum) and
  the `DependencySummary`/`DependencyEndpoint` contracts the dependency API and web
  logic editor agree on. Documentation: ADR-0021 records the DAG invariant and the
  service-layer cycle-prevention strategy; DECISIONS.md records the permission
  namespace and link cascade/restore behaviour.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- [#10](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/10) [`a3e9e01`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/a3e9e01d4684f945b48cd116374a545d39a7f9bc) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Fix `@repo/types` so it resolves under classic `tsc` without a prior build.
  Its top-level `types` field pointed at `./dist/index.d.ts`, but the API compiles
  with `moduleResolution: "Node"`, which ignores `exports` and reads that field —
  so any `tsc` run outside Turbo's `^build` graph (the `verify-template.sh`
  type-check and the e2e Playwright web server) failed with `TS2307` because
  `dist/` had not been built. The field now points at `./src/index.ts`, so
  type-checking resolves from source everywhere; the Node runtime is unaffected
  because it resolves the `exports.default` condition to `./dist/index.js`.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#8](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/8) [`cfe1d24`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/cfe1d2485ff2d1b8deeaf4328c5691754c91da40) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Fix the API container crashing on boot with `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING`.
  `@repo/types` shipped raw TypeScript (its `exports` pointed at `src/index.ts`),
  which tools transpile but plain Node cannot load — so the production image
  crashed when the compiled API `require`d it. `@repo/types` now builds to
  `dist/` (ESM + declarations) and its `exports` resolve to the compiled output at
  runtime, while the `development`/`types` conditions still point at source so
  dev, tests, and typecheck are unchanged. The API and web Docker builds compile
  `@repo/types` before the app, and `turbo dev` depends on it too.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/2) [`56a82ca`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/56a82ca5fe650a70f0792d5b31f66dd964be92bf) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Add organisation invitations and a transactional-mail port. Org Admins can
  invite by email with a role (`POST /organizations/:orgSlug/invitations`), list
  pending invites, and revoke them; invitees preview by token
  (`POST /invitations/preview`) and accept (`POST /invitations/accept`) to join.
  Tokens are stored hashed (raw value returned once + emailed), invitations expire,
  and accept is transactional. Adds a `MailService` port with a logging stub
  adapter (the accept URL is also returned so onboarding works without a provider)
  and the shared `InvitationSummary`/`InvitationPreview` contracts to `@repo/types`.
  Introduces a `410 Gone` error for expired/revoked invitations.

- [#2](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/2) [`56a82ca`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/56a82ca5fe650a70f0792d5b31f66dd964be92bf) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Add the organisations tenancy core. New `Organization` and `OrgMember` models
  (the canonical org-scoping foundation: UUID v7, soft-delete, audit, optimistic
  locking, partial-unique slug and one-membership-per-user indexes) and the
  `organizations` module: `POST /api/v1/organizations` (creator becomes Org Admin,
  atomically, with slug uniquification), `GET /api/v1/organizations` (the caller's
  orgs), and `GET /api/v1/organizations/:orgSlug` (404 for non-members —
  anti-enumeration). The auth seam now hydrates a principal's memberships and
  permissions from the database, so `/api/v1/me` returns real memberships and
  `principal.can(permission, orgId)` is enforced. Adds the shared
  `OrganizationSummary` contract to `@repo/types`.

- [#2](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/2) [`56a82ca`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/56a82ca5fe650a70f0792d5b31f66dd964be92bf) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Add membership management. New endpoints under the organisation scope:
  `GET /api/v1/organizations/:orgSlug/members` (cursor-paginated roster with user
  profiles), `PATCH .../members/:memberId` (change role, Org Admin only, with
  optimistic locking and the last-Org-Admin invariant), and
  `DELETE .../members/:memberId` (soft-delete, Org Admin only, last-admin
  protected). Every route resolves the org scope from the caller's memberships
  (404 for non-members; 403 for insufficient role). Adds the shared
  `OrgMemberSummary` contract to `@repo/types`.

- [#2](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/pull/2) [`56a82ca`](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/SchedulePoint_1/commit/56a82ca5fe650a70f0792d5b31f66dd964be92bf) Thanks [@HuttonHomeHub](https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub)! - Wire up authentication and the current-user endpoint (walking skeleton). Mounts
  Better Auth (`/api/auth/*`, email + password, cookie sessions) behind the
  `AuthContextService` seam, adds the identity tables (`users`, `sessions`,
  `accounts`, `verifications`) as the first migration, and exposes an
  authenticated `GET /api/v1/me` returning the signed-in user and their
  organisation memberships. Adds the shared `MeResponse` / `SessionUser` /
  `OrganizationRole` contracts to `@repo/types`.
