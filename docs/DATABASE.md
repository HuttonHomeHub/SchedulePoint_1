# Database Standards

> Standards and philosophy for the Blank App data layer: **PostgreSQL 17 + Prisma**.
> The schema in [`apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`](../apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma)
> is the single source of truth for the data model. See ADR-0008.

## Philosophy

1. **The database is a long-lived asset.** Data outlives code; schema decisions
   are made carefully and are hard to reverse. Model for correctness first.
2. **The database enforces integrity.** Constraints, foreign keys, and types are
   guardrails in the database, not just in application code — the DB is the last
   line of defence for data correctness.
3. **Migrations are the only way to change schema.** No manual edits to any
   environment; every change is a reviewed, versioned, committed migration.
4. **Access only through Prisma.** No hand-built SQL strings; parameterised
   queries always (also a security control — see `docs/SECURITY_STANDARDS.md`).
5. **Exact numeric data uses exact types.** If the app handles money, store it as
   integer minor units with an explicit currency — never floats (see
   [`API.md`](API.md)).

## Naming conventions

- **Tables:** plural `snake_case` (`reference_items`, `organization_members`).
- **Columns:** `snake_case` (`created_at`, `organization_id`).
- **Primary keys:** `id`, **UUID v7** (time-ordered) where possible for good
  index locality without exposing counts.
- **Foreign keys:** `<referenced_singular>_id` (`organization_id`).
- **Indexes:** `idx_<table>_<cols>`; **unique:** `uq_<table>_<cols>`;
  **checks:** `ck_<table>_<rule>`.
- **Enums:** `snake_case` type, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` values.
- **Booleans:** positive (`is_active`), not negated.
- In Prisma models we use `@@map`/`@map` so Prisma's `camelCase` fields map to
  `snake_case` columns, keeping both idioms clean.

## Migrations

- Generated and applied with **Prisma Migrate**. Locally: `prisma migrate dev`;
  in CI/prod: `prisma migrate deploy` (before the new app version serves
  traffic).
- **Committed and reviewed.** Migration SQL is part of the PR and read in review.
- **Expand/contract for zero-downtime:** add new nullable columns/tables first
  (expand), backfill, switch reads/writes, then remove the old (contract) in a
  later release — never a breaking rename in one step.
- **Forward-only in production.** "Rollback" = a new compensating migration plus
  redeploying the previous image; destructive changes are gated and reviewed
  with extra care.
- Migrations are deterministic and independent of application code state.

## Indexes

- **Index every column used in a `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, or foreign key.**
- Composite indexes follow the **leftmost-prefix** rule; order columns by
  selectivity/usage. Add **partial indexes** for common filtered queries (e.g.
  `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`).
- Unique constraints for natural keys; back them with unique indexes.
- Indexes are not free (write cost, storage) — **add them for real query
  patterns, and measure** (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`); remove unused ones.

## Constraints

- **Foreign keys** on every relationship, with explicit `ON DELETE` behaviour
  (usually `RESTRICT`; `CASCADE` only for true ownership/composition).
- **`NOT NULL`** by default; nullable is a deliberate decision.
- **`CHECK`** constraints for domain rules (e.g. non-negative amounts, valid
  enum ranges) — enforce invariants in the DB, not only in code.
- **Unique** constraints for anything that must be unique (scoped where relevant,
  e.g. unique name per organisation).

## Relationships

- Model relationships explicitly with foreign keys; prefer normalised design and
  denormalise only with a measured reason (documented).
- Many-to-many via an explicit **join table** with its own audit columns.
- Multi-tenant data carries its scoping key (e.g. `organization_id`) and is always
  filtered by it in queries (defence against cross-tenant leaks).

## Transactions

- **Wrap multi-step writes in a transaction** (`prisma.$transaction`) so they are
  atomic; the **service layer owns transaction boundaries**.
- Keep transactions **short**; do no external I/O (HTTP, queue publish) inside a
  transaction — publish after commit.
- Choose isolation deliberately; use appropriate levels for read-modify-write on
  contended rows (see optimistic locking).

## Soft deletes

- Default to **soft delete** via a nullable `deleted_at timestamptz`. Deletes set
  the timestamp; **all queries exclude soft-deleted rows by default** (a Prisma
  extension/base repository enforces this centrally — never rely on every caller
  remembering).
- Unique constraints that must ignore deleted rows use **partial unique indexes**
  (`WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`).
- **Hard deletes** are reserved for compliance/erasure requests and are explicit,
  audited, and rare.

## Auditing

- Every table carries **`created_at`** and **`updated_at`** (`timestamptz`,
  UTC), maintained automatically.
- Ownership/change attribution via **`created_by`** / **`updated_by`** (the
  acting principal) where meaningful.
- Security- and sensitive changes also emit an **append-only audit-log
  entry** (who/what/when/before→after) — see `docs/SECURITY_STANDARDS.md`
  (Audit logging). The audit log is never mutated.

## Optimistic locking

- Mutable rows subject to concurrent edits carry an integer **`version`** column.
- Updates are conditional on the expected version
  (`WHERE id = ? AND version = ?`) and **increment it**; a zero-row update means
  someone else changed it → the API returns **409 Conflict** so the client can
  refetch and retry. This avoids lost updates without long-held locks.
- Demonstrated in the reference feature.

## Data types & conventions

- Timestamps: `timestamptz`, stored UTC. Text: `text` (not arbitrary
  `varchar(n)` unless a real limit applies). Money (if the app has any):
  `integer`/`bigint` minor units + currency code. Identifiers: `uuid`. Enums:
  Postgres enums via Prisma.
- No business logic in triggers/stored procedures unless justified and
  documented (keep logic in the app for testability).

## Testing & performance

- Integration tests run against a **real Postgres** (see [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md)).
- Profile with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`; watch for N+1 (Prisma `include`/`select`),
  missing indexes, and unbounded queries. **Paginate everything.** See
  [`PERFORMANCE.md`](PERFORMANCE.md).
